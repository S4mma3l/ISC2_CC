### Summary

#### Key Concepts

1. **Networks**: Connection of two or more computers to share data, information, or resources.
2. **LAN and WAN**: Local Area Networks (LAN) cover limited geographical areas, while Wide Area Networks (WAN) connect remote locations.
3. **Network Hardware**:
    - **Hubs**: Basic devices that connect multiple devices.
    - **Switches**: Smarter than hubs, route traffic to specific devices.
    - **Routers**: Determine the most efficient route for network traffic.
    - **Firewalls**: Filter traffic based on security rules.
4. **OSI Model**: Divides network tasks into 7 layers, from physical to application.
5. **TCP/IP Protocol**: Standardizes communication in networks with specific functions at each layer.
6. **IPv4 and IPv6**: IP addresses to identify devices. IPv6 improves address capacity and security.
7. **Network Security**:
    - **Secure Ports**: Use encrypted alternatives like HTTPS instead of HTTP.
    - **Security Protocols**: Implement tools like SSH and TLS to protect data.
