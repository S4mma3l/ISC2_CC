### Summary

#### Key Concepts and Processes

1. **Business Continuity (BC)**: Actions and tools to ensure an organization can maintain critical operations during a contingency.
2. **Business Continuity Plan (BCP)**: Documentation with instructions on how to sustain key processes during and after a significant disruption.
3. **Disaster Recovery (DR)**: Restoration of critical IT and communication services following a disruption.
4. **Incident Response (IR)**: Mitigation of security breaches through a set of documented processes.
5. **Common Components**:
    - **Preparation**: Development of policies, training, and simulations.
    - **Detection and Analysis**: Monitoring and identification of incidents.
    - **Containment and Eradication**: Problem isolation and threat elimination.
    - **Post-Incident Activity**: Documentation of lessons learned and future adjustments.

#### Key Terminology

1. **Incident**: Event that jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a system.
2. **Exploit**: Attack that takes advantage of vulnerabilities in a system.
3. **Zero Day**: Previously unknown vulnerability.
4. **Business Impact Analysis (BIA)**: Identification of key functions and their importance to the organization.
5. **Intrusion**: Unauthorized access to a system or resource.
