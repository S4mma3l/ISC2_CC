### Summary

#### Key Concepts

1. **Security Control**: Safeguards to protect the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) of data. Examples include firewalls, authentication mechanisms, and access protocols.
2. **Access Control**: Limitation of access to resources based on specific rules. It focuses on three elements: subjects, objects, and rules.
3. **Least Privilege**: Providing only the access necessary to perform specific functions, reducing risks of misuse.
4. **Segregation of Duties**: Dividing critical tasks among multiple people to prevent fraud or errors.
5. **Physical Security Controls**: Tangible elements like locks, cameras, and guards to protect facilities and personnel.
6. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of controls to protect data and systems, combining physical, logical, and administrative measures.

#### Types of Controls

1. **Physical**: Examples include doors, locks, and mantraps.
2. **Technical**: Firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and multi-factor authentication.
3. **Administrative**: Policies, procedures, and training.

### Glossary

1. **CIA**: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.
2. **Firewall**: Device that controls network traffic based on security rules.
3. **Least Privilege**: Restriction of access to the minimum necessary.
4. **Segregation of Duties**: Division of critical responsibilities.
5. **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Identity validation using more than one factor (e.g., password and biometrics).
6. **CPTED (Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design)**: Environmental design to prevent crimes.

### Key Information for the Exam

1. **Definition of subjects and objects**: A subject is who requests access, and an object is the resource being accessed.
2. **Access rules**: Define who can interact with which resources and under what conditions.
3. **Physical access control**: Examples include cameras, locks, and magnetic cards.
4. **Defense in Depth**: Use of multiple control layers to mitigate risks.
5. **Segregation of Duties**: Prevention of conflicts of interest through task distribution.
