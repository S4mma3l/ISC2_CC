### Document Summary

#### Security Principles
1. **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that only authorized individuals have access to information. It relates to protecting personal data (PII, PHI) and information sensitivity.
2. **Integrity**: Ensuring that data is not altered in an unauthorized way and maintaining its internal consistency.
3. **Availability**: Ensuring that information and systems are accessible to authorized users when needed.
4. **Authentication**: Validating user identity through methods such as passwords, tokens, and biometrics.
5. **Non-repudiation**: Preventing individuals from denying actions they have performed, ensuring accountability in transactions.
6. **Privacy**: The right to control the distribution of personal information and compliance with regulations such as GDPR.

#### Risk Management
1. **Risk Identification**: Continuously identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities.
2. **Risk Assessment**: Analyzing and prioritizing risks to mitigate their impact on operations, assets, and individuals.
3. **Risk Treatment**:
   - Avoid.
   - Accept.
   - Mitigate through controls.
   - Transfer via insurance.
4. **Risk Tolerance**: Determining acceptable levels of risk based on context and geographical location.
5. **Risk Prioritization**: Using matrices to classify risks by probability and impact.

#### Security Controls
1. **Physical Controls**: Protecting spaces using devices like card readers, barriers, and access mechanisms.
2. **Technical Controls**: Implementing measures in IT systems, such as software and hardware configurations, to safeguard information.
3. **Administrative Controls**: Policies and guidelines to direct behavior and operations within the organization.

#### Governance and Ethics
1. **Code of Ethics**: Guidelines to maintain professionalism and appropriate conduct in cybersecurity.
2. **Governance Processes**: Establishing policies, procedures, and regulations to ensure compliance.
